# Exercise 3 - Use a deployment to deploy MySQL #

In this exercise you will create a *deployment* to deploy your MySQL container.
Start from the work that you have done in the previous exercise and modify the yaml file in order to create the deployment without using raw pods.

**Note**: You are not expected to use persistent volumes.

At the end of this exercise, launch MySQL workbench and connect to your deployed instance to verify that you can connect with your secrets. Keep in mind that you will have to expose your mysql server to a public endpoint.
